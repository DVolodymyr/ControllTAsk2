              <p>Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind. The truth is,
                our thoughts are
                very powerful.</p>
              <p>They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our social
                behaviors. I’m
                sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”</p>

              <p>If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in
                a
                positive way
                has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and prosperity.
                But how? How do
                we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?</p>

              <p> We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a
                mindset, a way of
                interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but it is
                simple enough if
                we keep working on it consistently.</p>

              <p>Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity
                into
                your life:</p>

              <p>Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express heartfelt
                gratitude for the
                good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each day. This helps
                to
                put your focus
                in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.</p>

              <p>Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such
                as “I
                am worthy of
                all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this will
                implant these
                thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.</p>

              <p>Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve,
                and
                then
                thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our
                subconscious
                will fill with
                images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See”
                yourself as being
                prosperous, and you will become so.</p>

              <p>Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your
                affirmations, but
                expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself
                to believe all
                things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you
                could. If you
                believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly
                successful.
                Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.</p>

              <p>Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you
                can
                only afford to
                put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.</p>

              <p>Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend
                more
                power and
                energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on wealth
                and prosperity
                will create . . . guess what?</p>

              <p>Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time,
                with consistent
                focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought, there
                are
                truly no
                limits to what you can create!</p>
