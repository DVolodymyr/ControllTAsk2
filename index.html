                <div class="desc_whatWeDo">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right
                  frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are
                  very powerful.
                  <span class="moreText">They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our
                    physical health to our social behaviors. I’m
                    sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

                    <p>If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of
                      thought
                      in a positive way
                      has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and
                      prosperity. But how? How do
                      we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?</p>

                    <p>We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is
                      a
                      mindset, a way of
                      interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but
                      it
                      is simple enough if
                      we keep working on it consistently.</p>

                    <p>Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
                      prosperity
                      into your life:</p>

                    <p>Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express
                      heartfelt
                      gratitude for the
                      good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each day. This
                      helps
                      to put your focus
                      in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.</p>

                    <p>Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements
                      such
                      as “I am worthy of
                      all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this
                      will
                      implant these
                      thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.</p>

                    <p>Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
                      achieve,
                      and then
                      thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our
                      subconscious will fill with
                      images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical.
                      “See”
                      yourself as being
                      prosperous, and you will become so.</p>

                    <p>Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of
                      your
                      affirmations, but
                      expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more. Allow
                      yourself to believe all
                      things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever
                      imagined
                      you could. If you
                      believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly
                      successful.
                      Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.</p>

                    <p>Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if
                      you
                      can only afford to
                      put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.
                    </p>

                    <p>Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we
                      lend
                      more power and
                      energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on
                      wealth and prosperity
                      will create . . . guess what?

                      Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over
                      time,
                      with consistent
                      focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought,
                      there
                      are truly no
                      limits to what you can create!

                  don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                  traffic won’t come from
                  here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for
                  posting to free
                  directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                  <p>2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people
                    go
                    when they are
                    looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
                    have
                    to resubmit them
                    quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on
                    them and weed the
                    others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on
                    when
                    you get the hang
                    of things.</p>

                  <p>3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is
                    to
                    write an article
                    about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to
                    check out your
                    product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one.
                    There are a lot of
                    webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post
                    yours, that is another
                    site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.</p>

                  <p>4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type
                    “Free URL
                    submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and
                    click
                    submit. That’s it.
                    It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.</p>

                  <p>5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some
                    forums. It will be
                    displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on, and
                    can
                    give a relevant
                    answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation.
                    Get involved asking
                    and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you
                    make
                    a post it stays
                    there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they
                    were searching the
                    archives. Yes, there are many people who do.</p>

                  <p>6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately
                    the
                    most effective.
                    Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit from
                    traffic exchanges. If
                    you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would
                    look into a program
                    that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are free
                    to
                    download. That
                    way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.</p>

                  <p>7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can
                    usually
                    mail the group
                    once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People will
                    tune you out if they
                    see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same
                    interests as yours. In
                    other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>

                    can
                    give a relevant
                    answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation.
                    Get involved asking
                    and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you
                    make
                    a post it stays
                    there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they
                    were searching the
                    archives. Yes, there are many people who do.</p>

                  <p>6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately
                    the
                    most effective.
                    Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit from
                    traffic exchanges. If
                    you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would
                    look into a program
                    that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are free
                    to
                    download. That
                    way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.</p>

                  <p>7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can
                    usually
                    mail the group

                    particular topic.
                    What’s great about

                    them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long periods of
                    time. It saves a lot of your time when you
                    don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                    traffic won’t come from
                    here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for
                    posting to free
                    directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                    <p>2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people
                      go
                      when they are
                      looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
                      have
                      to resubmit them
                      quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate
                      on
                      them and weed the
                      others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on
                      when
                      you get the hang
                      of things.</p>

                    <p>3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service
                      is
                      to
                      write an article
                      about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can go
                      to
                      check out your
                      product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one.
                      There are a lot of
                      webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post
                      yours, that is another
                      site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.</p>

                    <p>4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just
                      type
                      “Free URL
                      submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and
                      click
                      submit. That’s it.
                      It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.
                    </p>

                    <p>5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on
                      some
                      forums. It will be
                      displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on, and
                      can
                      give a relevant
                      answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                      reputation.

                        that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are
                        free to

                        mail the group
                        once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People
                        will
                        tune you out if they
                        see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same
                        interests as yours. In
                        other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.
