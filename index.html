              <h2>See The Unmatched Beauty Of The Great. Lakes.</h2>
              <p>Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are... searching for <span
                  class="hovering">a particular topic.
                  What’s great about

                  them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long periods of
                  time. It saves a lot of your time when you
                  don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                  traffic won’t come from
                  here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for
                  posting to free
                  directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                  <p>2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people
                    go
                    when they are
                    looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
                    have
                    to resubmit them
                    quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on
                    them and weed the
                    others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on
                    when
                    you get the hang
                    of things.</p>

                  <p>3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is
                    to
                    write an article
                    about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to
                    check out your
                    product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one.
                    There are a lot of
                    webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post
                    yours, that is another
                    site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.</p>

                  <p>4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type
                    “Free URL
                    submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and
                    click
                    submit. That’s it.
                    It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.</p>

                  <p>5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some
                    forums. It will be
                    displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on, and
                    can
                    give a relevant
                    answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation.
                    Get involved asking
                    and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you
                    make
                    a post it stays
                    there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they
                    were searching the
                    archives. Yes, there are many people who do.</p>

                  <p>6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately
                    the
                    most effective.
                    Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit from
                    traffic exchanges. If
                    you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would
                    look into a program
                    that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are free
                    to
                    download. That
                    way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.</p>

                  <p>7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can
                    usually
                    mail the group
                    once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People will
                    tune you out if they
                    see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same
                    interests as yours. In
                    other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>

            <h2>See The Unmatched Beauty Of The Great. Lakes.</h2>
            <p>Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are... searching for <span
                class="hovering">a
                particular topic.
                What’s great about

                them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long periods of
                time. It saves a lot of your time when you
                don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                traffic won’t come from
                here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for
                posting to free
                directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                <p>2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go
                  when they are
                  looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you have
                  to resubmit them
                  quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on
                  them and weed the
                  others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when
                  you get the hang
                  of things.</p>

                <p>3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is to
                  write an article
                  about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to
                  check out your
                  product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one.
                  There are a lot of
                  webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post
                  yours, that is another
                  site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.</p>

                <p>4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type
                  “Free URL
                  submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and click
                  submit. That’s it.
                  It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.</p>

                <p>5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some
                  forums. It will be
                  displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can
                  give a relevant
                  answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation.
                  Get involved asking
                  and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you make
                  a post it stays
                  there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they
